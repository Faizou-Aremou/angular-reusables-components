<p id="text">
  <b>Drag and drop a text selection from this paragraph</b>. Drag and drop any
  part of this text to the drop zone. Notice in the code: there is no need for a
  dragstart handler in case of text selection: the text is added to the
  clipboard when dragged with a key/name equal to "text/plain". Just write a
  drop handler that will do an event.dataTransfert.getData("text/plain") and you
  are done!
</p>

<p class="notDraggable">
  This paragraph is not selectable, however. Look at the CSS in the source code.

<div
  class="box"
